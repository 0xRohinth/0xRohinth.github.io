## About me
Hi! I'm Rohinth Rathna, a passionate Cybersecurity student with a strong interest in Blue Team operations, SOC analysis, and malware research.

I’m currently pursuing my undergraduate studies in B. E. Computer Science and Engineering and hold the Google cloud cybersecurity certificate (Google Cloud). My goal is to become a skilled SOC Analyst who can detect, respond, and defend against real-world cyber threats.

Over the past few months, I’ve been diving deep into:

- Penetration testing

- Bug bounty hunting

- Malware analysis

Security operations & threat detection

I’ve also completed a one-month internship in IoT and Embedded Systems at Taras Solutions, where I explored the fundamentals of hardware security.

Currently, I'm training on the Security Blue Team platform to sharpen my skills in SIEM tools, log analysis, and threat detection.

I believe that cybersecurity is not just about defending systems—it's about understanding how things break, so we can build them better.

When I’m not analyzing logs or scanning web apps, I’m learning from the community, trying out challenges on TryHackMe, Hack The Box, and working on personal security labs.

Feel free to explore my projects, check out my write-ups, or connect with me if you share the same passion for securing the digital world!
